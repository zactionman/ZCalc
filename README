ZCalc - A simple calculator.

This program was written just to practice some python.
It is a simple calculator with a GUI that allows a user to do math.

Everything should be fairly self explanetory in this program.  Click
on the number buttons to input a number then choose an operator.
Click the number buttons to enter the second number and press '='
to calculate the answer.

Currently this program is missing a way to delete numbers and clear numbers.
That should be easy enough to implement going forward, but because of the lack
of these simple, but necessary, operations I am not going to call this version
release 1.0.
